# Data-Science-Job-Salaries-Dashboard (Tableau)

I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize salary trends in the data science industry. The dashboard provides insights into various factors affecting job salaries, such as job roles, locations, experience levels, and industries. Users can explore trends, compare salaries across regions, and identify high-paying roles in the field. This project demonstrates my ability to process, analyze, and present data effectively, empowering users to make data-driven decisions.
